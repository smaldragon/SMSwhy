This is an alternate Sega Master System motherboard in a 10cmX10cm format.

## Why

Felt like it

## Should I use it

Short Answer: No. It's 100% untested and I'm not sure there is even enough clearance for cartridges to plug in

## What can I do with this?

It's released under the unlicense, so feel free to modify it to your heart's content. You can also use the schematic for a resonable-sized board if you want. But remember: This is all untested and might have mistakes, so uh, double check everything if you go that route.

## What revisions is this board compatible with?

This was designed for the chips present in the "Master System II Power Base RGB" (the later french revision which lacks IC9), with a Alex Kidd bios. The output is RGB via scart.

## What additional chips are here that weren't in the original board?

A AMS1117 5volt regulator and a THS7375 video amplifier, both are SMD parts and still active as of writing of this readme

## Any additions?

It has a RESET button, a PAL/NTSC selector switch, room for a power LED, and some 1.27mm headers that could be used to install a (custom) designed FM board.
